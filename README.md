# 🛠️ Tool Attributes Modder FINAL

# 🎯 Purpose
- This script enables users to view and modify the values of the attributes on any Roblox tool they currently have equipped. All modifications are performed in real-time through a GUI. (Only some tools have attributes to modify in some games)

# 🚀 Usage
- Execute the script to load the GUI
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nyxusss/loadstring/refs/heads/main/AttributesModderSource.lua",true))()
```
- Equip: Equip a tool that has attributes. The GUI will automatically populate with the list of the tool's attributes.
- Edit: Modify the values directly in the text boxes (for numbers/strings) or click the toggle button (for booleans).
- Apply: Click the APPLY CHANGES button to save the new values to the equipped tool, if its numbers/strings press enter first.

# 🤖 AI Disclaimer
- In this script AI was used to create the GUI, all other functions to detect tools, etc. were created by me and few functions fixed by AI

# 🛠️ Tool Attributes Modder FINAL

# 🎯 Purpose
- This script enables users to view and modify the values of the attributes on any Roblox tool they currently have equipped. All modifications are performed in real-time through a GUI. (Only some tools have attributes to modify in some games)

# 🚀 Usage
- Execute the script to load the GUI
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nyxusss/loadstring/refs/heads/main/AttributesModderSource.lua",true))()
```
- Equip: Equip a tool that has attributes. The GUI will automatically populate with the list of the tool's attributes.
- Edit: Modify the values directly in the text boxes (for numbers/strings) or click the toggle button (for booleans).
- Apply: Click the APPLY CHANGES button to save the new values to the equipped tool, if its numbers/strings press enter first.

# ⚠️ Usage Disclaimer
- THE USE OF EXPLOITS VIOLATES ROBLOX'S TERMS OF SERVICE.
  Roblox explicitly prohibits the use of exploits to gain an unfair advantage on the platform or bypass game limitations. Using scripts such as this "Tool Attributes Modder" may result in the temporal/permanent suspension or deletion of your account.
- Under no circumstances should this be used in public experiences to gain an advantage ("cheating/exploiting") or disrupt the experience of other players.
- This script is intended strictly for educational purposes, vulnerability testing, or personal debugging in controlled environments where you have explicit permission to execute client-side code (such as private development servers or experiences you have created yourself).

- Enjoy. 😉
